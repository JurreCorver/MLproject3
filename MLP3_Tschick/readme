Description
((i) feature extraction
Using the nibabel/NIfTI tools to read the intensity of fMRI image, and take each 3D fMRI as a data point. Blocklizing each fMRI by 0 to 3 levels. It means that we blocklize the 3D fMRI to 8*8*8 blocks by dichotimizing along the 3 axis for 3 times. According to the intensity of each block, we proposed to compute the histogram features with 64 bins for each block. In total there are (1 + 8 + 8*8 + 8*8*8)*64 (in total is 37440) features extracted for each training and testing fMRI.

(ii) multiclassification model
Base model: using the logistic regression based classifer as the base classifer of oneVsRestclassifer from sklearn package. The logistc regression classifer applies 10 fold cross validation. 

Pipeline: To adapt the model to the training dataset, we apply the pipeline model to the base classifer using the standard scaler. We used the sklearn package.
